                    With continuous passion to learn and great curiosity, 
                    I have been eagerly exploring the digital technology world. 
                    After an initial study in Networking, I have recently completed a boot camp in UX/UI designs. The major component is this course is focus on the practical use of software and programs as explained. 
                    I thoroughly enjoyed learning about the human centred design work. When working on each of my project work, I have learnt to use the Design Thinking and usability heuristics to create contents that is able to satisfy user needs .
